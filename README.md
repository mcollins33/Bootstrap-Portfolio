Hi! Welcome to my website!  My name is Miki Collins and I am an aspiring full stack developer.  I am currently enrolled in Georgia Tech's Fall 2017 Coding Bootcamp with expected completion in February 2018.  

This site is meant for potential employers to learn a little about me and see my progress as I make my way through this course.

As of 11/26/17 I have updated images two on my Portfolio page and have working links to Hangman and Crystals Collector games.  These games were created using JavaScript and JQuery.

11/13/17 I have incorporated Javascript into my code to make my website responsive. 

11/10/17 I have created this website using html and css.  You can learn a little more about me in the "About Me" section on the Index page.  I have working links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow sites.  I also have working links in the navigation bar to my Portfolio and Contact pages.  The links in the Portfolio section of the Portfolio page are currently inoperable as these are future projects.  The form on the Contact page is also inoperable at this time.
